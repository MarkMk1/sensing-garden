"""Pollen: the device-side upload subsystem.

Owns a SQLite-backed queue, the upload loop, retention, and cleanup. The app enqueues an
artifact (result / heartbeat / log) as it is produced; a background loop uploads
pending items (per-object, or bundled into an archive when batching is on),
marks each success, then deletes the local file and prunes its row.

Lifecycle: ``start()`` runs the loop in a thread; ``flush()`` drains the queue to
empty while still accepting new enqueues; ``stop()`` halts the loop.
